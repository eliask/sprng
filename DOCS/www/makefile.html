<H2>Platform dependent compilation</H2>

There is a file included in the  SPRNG distribution called
<SAMP>make.CHOICES</SAMP> which sets the platform for compilation.
Once this file is properly edited, the user can build the SPRNG libraries 
by simply using the <SAMP>make</SAMP> command. 

<P>The <SAMP>make.CHOICES</SAMP> file looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>
#PLAT = CONVEX
PLAT = SGI
#PLAT = SP2
#PLAT = T3D
</PRE>
<P>
If users wish to build SPRNG on the HP/Convex Exemplar, then they
should comment out the line specifying the SGI and uncomment
the line specifying the CONVEX as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
PLAT = CONVEX
#PLAT = SGI
#PLAT = SP2
#PLAT = T3D
</PRE>
<P>
Then, the <SAMP>make</SAMP> command will build the libraries using the 
compiler options set in the file <SAMP>SRC/make.CONVEX</SAMP>   The user
may wish to edit this file if a different compiler or different compiler 
options are wanted.
<P>
<H2>Variables in the Makefile</H2>
We shall next describe the different variables defined in the
<SAMP>make.</SAMP><VAR>platform</VAR> files. We take as an example <A
HREF="platforms.html">platform</A> the <SAMP>make.SGI</SAMP> for use in an
SGI Power Challenge. The relevant portion of the file is as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
AR = ar
ARFLAGS = cr
#If your system does not have ranlib, then replace next statement with 
#RANLIB = echo
RANLIB = ranlib
CC = cc
CLD = $(CC)
F77 = f77
F77LD = $(F77)
FFXN = -DAdd_
# 64 bit compilation
#
# To use MPI, set the MPIDIR to location of mpi library, and MPILIB 
# to name of mpi library. Remove # signs from beginning of next 3 lines.
# Also, if the previous compilation was without MPI, type: make realclean
# before compiling for mpi.
#
MPIDEF = -DSPRNG_MPI #Only if you plan to use MPI
MPIDIR = -L/usr/lib64
MPILIB = -lmpi
#
CFLAGS = -O2 -D$(PLAT) $(MPIDEF) -D_LONG_LONG -align64 -64  
CLDFLAGS =  -align64 -64 # 64 bit compilation
FFLAGS = -O2 -align64   $(MPIDEF)  -DPOINTER_SIZE=8 -D_LONG_LONG -64  #64 bit compilation
F77LDFLAGS =  -align64 -64 # 64 bit compilation
CPP = gcc -E -P   $(MPIDEF)  -DPOINTER_SIZE=8 -D_LONG_LONG # 64 bit compilation
</PRE>
<P>
<H3>Descriptions of variables</H3>
<SAMP>AR</SAMP> is the command to archive the library.
<P>
<SAMP>ARFLAGS</SAMP> is the flag to the archiver. Here we 
create the library or replace the object files already archived.
<P>
<SAMP>RANLIB</SAMP> is essentially used to generate the table of
contents to the library. 
<P>
<SAMP>CC</SAMP> and <SAMP>CLD</SAMP> are the C compiler and loader
respectively.
<P>
<SAMP>F77</SAMP> and <SAMP>F77LD</SAMP> are the FORTRAN77 compiler and loader
respectively.
<P>
<SAMP>FFXN</SAMP> is needed for the following reason. SPRNG is written
in C. FORTRAN wrappers are also available, which provide an interface
to FORTRAN users. These wrappers are actually C functions. When a
FORTRAN user calls a wrapper function <VAR>fxn</VAR>, FORTRAN compilers often
change the name to something else, for example
<VAR>fxn</VAR><SAMP>_</SAMP>. Thus the wrappers should also have their
function names modified the same way. The flag <SAMP>FFXN</SAMP>
ensures that the correct modification is made to the wrapper function
names during SPRNG installation.
<P>
<SAMP>CFLAGS</SAMP> and <SAMP>CLDFLAGS</SAMP> are the flags to the C compiler and loader
respectively.
<P>
<SAMP>FFLAGS</SAMP> and <SAMP>F77LDFLAGS</SAMP> are the  flags to the
FORTRAN77 compiler and loader respectively.
<P>
<SAMP>CPP</SAMP> is provided for the sake of those FORTRAN compilers
which are not capable of calling the C <A
HREF="definitions.html#preprocess">preprocessor</A>. SPRNG executables and
example programs in FORTRAN have names of the form
<VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.F</SAMP>, and involve preprocessing
directives. If some compiler cannot accept such a file, then
we preprocess the file using the command:
<P>
 <VAR>CPP </VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.F  </SAMP>
<P>
The
 resulting file is called either
<VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.f</SAMP> or
<VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.i</SAMP>. In the latter case, the user
should move it to a file called  <VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.f</SAMP> by
issuing the following command:
<P>
<KBD>mv</KBD> <VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.i</SAMP> <VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.f</SAMP>  
<P>
<VAR>filename</VAR><SAMP>.f</SAMP> can be processed by the user's
FORTRAN compiler. 
<P>
<SAMP>MPIDEF</SAMP> should be set to <SAMP>-DSPRNG_MPI</SAMP> if the
usr is installing the <A HREF="message-passing.html#mpi">MPI</A>
version of SPRNG. This line should be commented out, by appending a #
sign, or removed otherwise. This flag causes a <A
HREF="definitions.html#macros"><EM>macro</EM></A> called
<SAMP>SPRNG_MPI</SAMP> to be defined in the SPRNG code, which enables
calls to MPI functions.
<P>
<SAMP>MPIDIR</SAMP> indicates the path to the MPI library.
<P>
<SAMP>MPILIB</SAMP> indicates the name of the MPI library.
<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> <SAMP>MPIDEF</SAMP>, <SAMP>MPIDIR</SAMP> and
<SAMP>MPILIB</SAMP> should be commented out or removed if the user
does not wish to install the MPI version of SPRNG.
<P>
Users may wish to use the above variables and flags in compiling their programs
too. However, the flags <SAMP>-DSPRNG_MPI</SAMP> and
<SAMP>-D_LONG_LONG</SAMP>, and the variables <SAMP>MPIDEF</SAMP> and <SAMP>FFXN</SAMP> are needed only
during the SPRNG installation. Users can take a look at the Makefile
in the EXAMPLES directory in order to see some compilation flags that
they might wish to use.

<P>
The flag <SAMP>-DPOINTERSIZE=8</SAMP> indicates that the size of the
pointer is 8 bytes. The default value assumed by SPRNG is 4
bytes.

<P>
