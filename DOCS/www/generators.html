<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> Generators </H1>
<P>

<A NAME="lcg48"></A> 
<H2>48 Bit Linear Congruential Generator with Prime Addend</H2>
<P>
The recurrence relation for the sequence of random numbers produced by
this generator is given by
the following recurrence: 
<P>
<SAMP>x(n) = a x(n-1) + p (Mod M)</SAMP>
<P>
where <SAMP>x(n)</SAMP> is the <SAMP>n</SAMP> th term in the sequence,
<EM>p</EM> is a
prime number and <EM>a</EM> is the multiplier. The value of
<EM>M</EM> for this generator is 2<SUP>48</SUP>. 
<P>
Different random number <A
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A> are obtained by
choosing different prime numbers as the addend <EM>p</EM>. There are
theoretical results by <A HREF="refs.html#percus">Percus and Kalos</A>  which suggest that such a
choice will yield reasonably <A
HREF="definitions.html#independence"><EM>independent</EM></A>
streams. We have <A HREF="tests.html">tested</A> this generator
empirically too. 
<P>
The <STRONG>period</STRONG> of this generator is <SAMP>2<SUP>48</SUP></SAMP>. The <STRONG>number of distinct
streams</STRONG> available is of the order of <SAMP>2<SUP>19</SUP></SAMP>. However, it is
possible to exhaust the set of distinct streams quite fast if the user
spawns streams too often. The distinct streams provided are more
independent, as
per the
theoretical analysis mentioned above, if the addends 
are large prime numbers. Thus
we provide streams with primes taken from the the high end of the
range during initialization. 

<P>
The multiplier
<EM>a</EM> is a <A HREF="parameters.html#lcg48">parameters</A> to this generator and can be set during
<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialization</EM></A>. 
<P>
When a call to <SAMP>isprng</SAMP> is made, the 31 high order bits of
<SAMP>x(n)</SAMP> are returned. When a call to <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> is
made, the result obtained is <SAMP>x(n)/M</SAMP>. 
<P>
Initialization with different <A
HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seeds</EM></A>  starts the
generator at different points in the sequence.
<P>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The low order bits of this sequence have a
small period. Therefore, if users utilizes certain bits of the
sequence in order to take certain decisions in their algorithm, they
should avoid using the low order bits.
<P>
This generator also has correlations between elements of the sequence
separated by powers of two. So users should avoid using numbers n at
a time where n is a power of two (such as 1024). 
<P>

<A NAME="lcg64"></A> 
<H2>64 Bit Linear Congruential Generator with Prime Addend</H2>
<P>
The features of this generator are similar to the <A
HREF="#lcg48">48 bit Linear Congruential Generator</A>, except that
the arithmetic is modulo 2<SUP>64</SUP>. The <A
HREF="parameters.html#lcg64">multipliers</A> for this generator are
different from those for the 48 bit generator.
<P>
The <STRONG>period</STRONG> of this generator is
<SAMP>2<SUP>64</SUP></SAMP>. The <STRONG>number of distinct
streams</STRONG> available is of the order of
<SAMP>2<SUP>19</SUP></SAMP>.


<A NAME="lfg"></A> 
<H2>Modified Lagged Fibonacci Generator</H2>
The recurrence relation for this sequence of random numbers is given by
the following equation: 
<P>
<SAMP>z(n) = x(n) XOR y(n)</SAMP>
<P>
where <SAMP>XOR</SAMP> is the <EM>exclusive-or</EM> operator, <SAMP>x</SAMP> and <SAMP>y</SAMP> are sequences obtained from
Lagged Fibonacci sequences <SAMP>X</SAMP> and <SAMP>Y</SAMP> of the following form:
<P>
<SAMP>X(n) = X(n-k) + X(n-l) (mod M)</SAMP><BR>
<SAMP>Y(n) = Y(n-k) + Y(n-l) (mod M)</SAMP><BR>
<P>
<EM>l</EM> and <EM>k</EM> are called the lags of the generator, and we
use the convention that <EM>l > k</EM>. M is
chosen to be 2<SUP>32</SUP>. <SAMP>X(n)</SAMP> and <SAMP>Y(n)</SAMP> are 32
bit integers. <SAMP>x</SAMP> is obtained from <SAMP>X</SAMP> by
setting the Least Significant Bit of the latter to
<SAMP>0</SAMP>. <SAMP>y</SAMP> is obtained from <SAMP>Y</SAMP> by
shifting the latter right by one bit. This modification of the Lagged
Fibonacci Generator is performed in order to avoid certain
correlations that are observed in the unmodified generator.
<P>
When a call to <SAMP>isprng</SAMP> is made, the 31 high order bits of
<SAMP>z(n)</SAMP> are returned. When a call to <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> is
made, the result obtained is <SAMP>z(n)/M</SAMP>. 
<P>

The <STRONG>period</STRONG> of this generator is
<SAMP>2<SUP>31</SUP>(2<SUP>l</SUP>-1)</SAMP> where <VAR>l</VAR> is the lag. For the
default generator with lag <SAMP>l = 1279</SAMP>, the period is
approximately <SAMP>2<SUP>1310</SUP></SAMP>. The <STRONG>number of distinct streams</STRONG>
available is <SAMP>2<SUP>[31(l-1)-1]</SUP></SAMP>. For the default generator this
gives <SAMP>2<SUP>39648</SUP></SAMP> distinct streams. However, users should
still be cautious while spawning new streams, since it is possible to
exhaust the set of distinct streams even without using all of them if they
 spawn often from only a few of the original streams.

<P>
The sequence obtained is determined by the <EM>l</EM> initial values
of the sequences <SAMP>X</SAMP> and <SAMP>Y</SAMP>. 
The <A HREF="definitions.html#seed"><EM>seed</EM></A> used during
<A HREF="definitions.html#initialize"><EM>initialization</EM></A> for
this generator does not move one to a different point in the
sequence. Rather, it returns a different sequence. The seeding
algorithms ensures that if the same seed is used for all the <A
HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A>,
then the streams obtained are <A
HREF="definitions.html#independence"><EM>independent</EM></A>. If a
user initializes  different streams with different seeds, then it is
possible that the same sequence may be assigned to two different
streams and hence we may no longer have independent streams. Thus it
is important to use the same seed while initializing all the streams
with this generator. <A HREF="tests.html">Test
results</A> for this generator's <A
HREF="definitions.html#quality"><EM>quality</EM></A> are also
available.
<P>
The <A HREF="parameters.html">parameters</A> to this generator are the
values of the lags. More details on this generator and the seeding
algorithms can be found papers by <A HREF="refs.html#mascagni1">Mascagni, et al</A>.
