<H1 ALIGN=CENTER> Physical Model Tests  </H1>
<P>
It is best to test random number generator in an application
similar to where it will be used. We have subjected our generators to
ISING model tests and random walk tests. The exact solution for these
tests are known, and the tests also have the structure of practical
applications. Thus they are good measures of the quality of the
generators. We hope that our results will give the computational
scientist a measure of the expected biases in the simulation. We
explain these test results in this section.

<DD>The <A HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/users/paulc/lectures/montecarlo/node8.html#SECTION00020000000000000000">Ising model</A> is a model proposed in
statistical mechanics that is simple enough that the exact solution is
known, but still realistic enough that it has practical
applications. In this model, a lattice of spin states is
maintained. For each configuration of spin states, it is possible to
calculate certain macroscopic properties. Different configurations are
generated, and the statistical average of the macroscopic quantity over
all the configurations generated is considered the observed value of
that quantity. Two popular <A
HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/users/paulc/lectures/montecarlo/node17.html#SECTION00030000000000000000">Monte
Carlo</A>
algorithms for generating the configurations are (i) the <A
HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/users/paulc/lectures/montecarlo/node24.html#SECTION00037000000000000000">Metropolis
Algorithm</A> and (ii) the <A
HREF="http://www.npac.syr.edu/users/paulc/lectures/montecarlo/node58.html#SECTION00066000000000000000">Wolff
Algorithm</A>. 

<H3>Sequential tests</H3> 
We present results for these two algorithms
with each of our generators for the Specific Heat and the Energy, were
we generated around 10<SUP>11</SUP> random numbers in our simulations
on a 16x16 lattice.

<P>
<H3>Parallel tests</H3> We simulated parallelism with the Metropolis
algorithm by maintaining a different random number stream at each of
the 256 lattice sites. This tests for correlations between
streams. The results for the Specific Heat and Energy are given below,
with a total of round 10<SUP>11</SUP> random numbers generated.

<A HREF="images/msE.ps">Energy</A> 

<P>
We need to be careful in choosing the seeds. Otherwise correlations
between the streams can cause poor results as in the examples shown
below. SPRNG users need not bother about this issue, since we
automatically handle it in our code.

<A NAME="random-walk"></A>
<DT><H2>Random Walk Tests</H2>
<P> 
<DD>In the Random Walk test, we start a "Random Walker" from a certain
position
on a two dimensional lattice. The random walker then takes a certain number of steps
to other lattice points. The direction of each step is determined from
the value returned by a random number generated. A series of such
tests are performed, and for each such test, the final position of the
random walker is noted. This distribution of positions is compared
with the expected distribution with a random number stream from a 
uniform distribution. A Chisquare value is computed as a
quantitative measure of the likelihood of the distribution being
uniform. 

<P>
This test can check for correlations between streams if we <A
HREF="test-suite.html#parseq-tests">interleave</A> streams to form a
new stream and run this test. We compared the probability of the
random walker being in each of the four quadrants, as in the tests
implemented by <A HREF="refs.html#vattulainen">Vattulainen, et
al</A>. Acceptable values were obtained for our generators with
10<SUP>8</SUP> random numbers generated, both in the sequential and
parallel tests.
