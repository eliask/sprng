<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>  Introduction   </H1>

SPRNG is a set of libraries for scalable and portable pseudorandom
number generation, and has been developed keeping in mind the
requirements of users involved in parallel Monte Carlo simulations.
<P>
Monte Carlo calculations consume a large fraction of all
supercomputing cycles. The accuracy of these
computations is critically influenced by the quality of the random
number generators used. While the issue of random number generation in
sequential calculations has been well studied, albeit on less
powerful computers, there has been
comparatively less work done in the context of parallel Monte Carlo
applications. SPRNG seeks to fill this gap by implementing parallel
random number generators that satisfy the requirements given below.
<P>
<H2>Desiderata for parallel random number generators</H2>
Users generally desire the following from any parallel random number generator:
<DL>
<DT><A HREF="definitions.html#quality">Quality:</A> <BR>
<BR>
  <DD>Provide ``high quality'' pseudorandom numbers in a
      computationally inexpensive and scalable manner. <BR>
<BR>

<DT><A HREF="definitions.html#reproducibility">Reproducibility:</A> <BR>
<BR>
 
  <DD>Provide totally reproducible <A HREF="definitions.html#stream"><EM>streams</EM></A> of parallel
      pseudorandom numbers, independent of the number of processors used in the
computation and of the loading produced by sharing of the parallel computer. <BR>
<BR>

<DT><A HREF="definitions.html#locality">Locality:</A> <BR>
<BR>

  <DD>Allow for the creation of unique pseudorandom number streams
on a parallel machine with minimal interprocessor communication. <BR>
<BR>

<DT><A HREF="definitions.html#portability">Portability:</A> <BR>
<BR>

<DD>Should be portable between serial and parallel platforms and
must be available on the most commonly used workstations and supercomputers. <BR>
</DL>
<BR>
SPRNG provides pseudorandom number generators that satisfy the above
requirements.<P>
<H2>Generators implemented in SPRNG</H2>
With the above goals in mind, SPRNG provides user-friendly interfaces for
parallel FORTRAN and C programs which enables the user to easily
obtain sufficiently uncorrelated pseudorandom number streams on
different processors, with minimal inter-processor
communication. Furthermore, the user can generate random numbers from
more than one stream on each processor.

<P>
 The
generators implemented in SPRNG are (i) two versions of <A HREF="generators.html#lcg48">Linear Congruential with Prime Addend</A>
and (ii) <A HREF="generators.html#lfg">modified Additive Lagged
Fibonacci</A>. Later versions will also implement other generators.
<P>
<H2>SPRNG functionality</H2>
SPRNG provides more functionality than just the ability to generate
independent streams on different processors. We mention two of these and
their applications below. (i) In order to balance the
load the user may want to assign the computations involving a
particular random number stream to a different process. A user may
also want to <A HREF="definitions.html#checkpoint"><EM>check-point</EM></A> the program. SPRNG facilitates these tasks by
enabling the user to obtain the state of a stream. (ii) In some
branching computations, new generators are <A HREF="definitions.html#spawn"><EM>spawned</EM></A> from old
ones. SPRNG enables the spawning of new streams while ensuring
their independence from streams on any of the processors, with minimal
inter-processor communication. Further details on the functionality
provided by SPRNG is given in the section on <A
HREF="usage.html">SPRNG usage</A>.
<P>
<H2>SPRNG features</H2>
In order to be accessible to a wide spectrum of supercomputer users, SPRNG
has the following features:
<DL>
<DT><A HREF="generators.html">Generators:</A> <BR>
<BR>

<DD><A HREF="generators.html#lcg48">Linear Congruential</A> and
<A HREF="generators.html#lfg">Additive Lagged Fibonacci</A> generators are
implemented. Maximal-Period
Shift Register generator will be available in future versions. <BR>
<BR>

<DT><A HREF="languages.html">Languages:</A> <BR>
<BR>

<DD><A HREF="languages.html#C">C</A> and <A
HREF="languages.html#fortran">FORTRAN</A> interfaces are
available. SPRNG is also callable from <A
HREF="languages.html#C++">C++</A>.<BR>
<BR>

<DT><A HREF="message-passing.html">Message Passing:</A> <BR>
<BR>
 
<DD>Support is available for programs using <A HREF="message-passing.html#mpi">MPI</A> for message passing. Support for
<A HREF="message-passing.html#pvm">PVM</A> may be added in later versions. However, PVM programs can still
use the current version. <BR>
<BR>

<DT><A HREF="test-suite.html">Test Suite:</A>  <BR>
<BR>

<DD>A test suite with statistical tests and tests based on physical
models (ex ISING model) will be provided in later verions. This can easily be used to test new generators. <BR>
<BR>

<DT><A HREF="platforms.html">Platforms:</A>  <BR>
<BR>

<DD>SPRNG has been ported to CRAY T3D, HP/Convex Exemplar, IBM SP2,
SGI-CRAY Origin 2000 and SGI Power
Challenge parallel computers. It has also been ported to HP and SUN
workstations, and also to PCs running Linux. Further optimization on these and other
platforms will be performed in future versions. <BR>

<P>
<DT><A HREF="newgen.html">Extensibility:</A>  <BR>
<BR>

<DD>SPRNG is easy to extend, and new parallel generators can easily be
developed to support SPRNG features.<BR>
