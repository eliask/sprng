<DL>

<DT> <STRONG>Obtaining SPRNG source code</STRONG>
<P>
<DD> SPRNG is available as a compressed tar file. In order to obtain
the source code, please perform the following steps:<BR>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI> Download the file <A HREF="sprng.tar.Z"></SAMP>sprng.tar.Z</SAMP></A>
 to
the location where you wish to place the source code.
<LI> In the directory where you have copied the file
</SAMP>sprng.tar.Z</SAMP>, execute the following command:<BR>
<BR>
<KBD>zcat sprng.tar.Z | tar xovf -</KBD><BR>
<BR>
</OL>  
A directory called <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> will be created, along with its
subdirectories. <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> is the main SPRNG directory. In
order to continue with the rest of the installation, please change to
the directory <SAMP>sprng</SAMP> by executing the following
command:<BR>
<BR>
<KBD>cd sprng</KBD>
<P>

<DT><STRONG>SPRNG organization</STRONG>
<P>
<DD>The main SPRNG directory, <SAMP>sprng</SAMP>, contains the
following subdirectories:<BR><BR> 
<OL>
<LI> <SAMP>SRC</SAMP> contains the source code for
the SPRNG libraries. The code for each generator is in a seperate
subdirectory. Code common to all the generators is in the SRC
directory itself.
<LI> <SAMP>EXAMPLES</SAMP> contains example
C and FORTRAN programs that demonstrate the use of the SPRNG libraries.
<LI> <SAMP>DOCS</SAMP> contains postscript
documentation on SPRNG.
<LI> <SAMP>TESTS</SAMP> contains source code for
routines that test the quality of the random number generators.
</OL>
<P>

<DT><STRONG>Building the SPRNG
libraries</STRONG>
<P>

<DD> In order to build the SPRNG libraries, the example programs and
the executables that test the quality of the random number generators,
you'll have to edit the file <KBD>make.CHOICES</KBD><BR>
<P>The <SAMP>make.CHOICES</SAMP> file looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>
#PLAT = CONVEX
PLAT = SGI
#PLAT = SP2
#PLAT = T3D
</PRE>
<P>
If users wish to build SPRNG on the HP/Convex Exemplar, then they
should comment out the line specifying the SGI and uncomment
the line specifying the CONVEX as follows:
<P>
<PRE>
PLAT = CONVEX
#PLAT = SGI
#PLAT = SP2
#PLAT = T3D
</PRE>
<P>
Then, the <SAMP>make</SAMP> command will build the libraries using the 
compiler options set in the file <SAMP>SRC/make.CONVEX</SAMP>   The user
may wish to edit this file if a different compiler or different compiler 
options are wanted.


<P>Currently SPRNG has been tested on <A
HREF="platforms.html#t3d">CRAY T3D</A>, <A HREF="platforms.html#exemplar">HP/CONVEX
Exemplar</A>, <A HREF="platforms.html#sp2">IBM SP2</A>, <A
HREF="platforms.html#origin2000">SGI-CRAY Origin 2000</A> and <A
HREF="platforms.html#power-challenge">SGI Power 
Challenge</A> parallel computers. It has also been ported to <A
HREF="platforms.html#hp">HP</A> and <A
HREF="platforms.html#sun">SUN</A> workstations and PC running <A HREF="platforms.html#linux">Linux</A>.

<P>

Alternatively, the subdirectories can be built individually by executing the
<KBD>make</KBD> command
in the desired subdirectory. However, the SRC subdirectory
<STRONG>must</STRONG> be built before the other subdirectories.

<P>
The compilation process includes a file called
<SAMP>make.</SAMP><VAR>platform</VAR>, depending on the platform. We have set certain variables
based on their setting on our systems. If they differ on
your system, please see our explanation for the <A
HREF="makefile.html">makefile</A> and make suitable changes.

<P>
 By
default, the SPRNG libraries are placed in the main SPRNG directory,
<SAMP>sprng</SAMP>. Along with the libraries, certain executables for
timing the generators and for checking whether the generators ported
correctly are also placed in this directory.
<P>

<DT><STRONG>Checking the
libraries</STRONG>
<P>

<DD> Once the SPRNG library has been built, the user should <A HREF="checksprng.html">check</A> that
the library has indeed ported correctly. Please execute the following
command in the directory <SAMP>sprng</SAMP>:<BR>
<BR>
<KBD>checksprng</KBD><BR>
<BR>
The output will give the results for the different SPRNG libraries and
interfaces. All the tests should be <EM>PASSED</EM>. If any of the
test <EM>FAILS</EM>, then SPRNG has not ported correctly. Please
<A HREF="mailto:ashoks@ncsa.uiuc.edu">report</A> this problem to us.
<P>

<DT> <STRONG>Timing the libraries</STRONG>
<P>
<DD> The user can check the <A HREF="timesprng.html">speed</A> of the different SPRNG random number
generators by executing the following
command in the directory <SAMP>sprng</SAMP>:<BR>
<BR>
<KBD>timesprng</KBD><BR>
<BR>
The output will give the time taken for generating a million random
numbers, and also the number of random numbers generated per second,
expressed in MRS (Million Random numbers per Second).
